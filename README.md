The aim is to create a cool website called "Little Library." It's like a
magical online place where anyone who loves books can go to read a
different kind of books without paying anything. In our tech-filled
world, this website is like a special virtual home for book fans. It
works on computers, tablets, and phones, so you can read anywhere.
You can explore, find, and really get into all sorts of amazing stories
and books.
At Little Library, if you have a favorite book that's not on the website,
you can ask us to add it! We're open to requests, and we want to
make sure you can read the books you love. It's your space, so feel
free to suggest any book you'd like to see on Little Library. We're here
to make your reading experience awesome!
Developing a website like "Little Library" requires selecting
appropriate technologies to ensure a smooth user experience and
effective platform management.
Here are some key technologies that I consider:
> Frontend Development:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Standard technologies for building the
structure, style, and interactivity of web pages.
> Backend Development:
Node.js : Backend frameworks that allow you to handle server-side
logic and manage data.
> MongoDB :
MongoDB is a NoSQL database,As a document database, MongoDB
makes it easy for developers to store structured or unstructured data.
It uses a JSON-like format to store documents.
> Authentication:
> JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
Implement secure user authentication using tokens to manage user
sessions.
